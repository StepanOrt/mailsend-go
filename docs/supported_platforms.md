# Supported Platforms

`mailsend-go` is written in [go](https://golang.org/), therefore, it can be cross compiled
for many platforms from one platform. This is the motivation for me to write it in
[go](https://golang.org/). 

The compiled binaries for the following platforms are supplied:

* Linux (tgz, debian and rpm)
* Windows (zip)
* MacOS (tgz, Homebrew)

Please add an [issue](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/issues) if you would need binaries for any other platforms.
