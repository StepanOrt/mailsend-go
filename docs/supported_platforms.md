# Supported Platforms

*mailsend-go* is written in [go](https://golang.org/), therefore, it can be cross compiled
for many platforms from one platform. This is the motivation for me to write it in
[go](https://golang.org/) as usually I do no have time to maintain multiple 
versions of [mailsend written in C](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend) and as
a result bugs were not getting fixed in timely manner.

The compiled binaries for the following platforms are supplied:

* Linux
* Windows
* MacOS

Please add an [issue](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/issues) if you would need binaries for any other platforms.
