# Introduction

`mailsend-go` is a command line tool to send mail via SMTP protocol. This is the
[golang](https://golang.org/) incarnation of my C version of
[mailsend](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend/). However, this version is much
simpler and all the heavy lifting is done by the package
[gomail.v2](https://gopkg.in/gomail.v2)

If you use [mailsend](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend), please consider
using mailsend-go as no new features will be added to 
[mailsend](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend).

If you have any question, request or suggestion, please enter it in the 
[Issues](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/issues) with appropriate label.

Please send a pull request if you updated, fixed a bug or updated the
documentation. 

If you would like to update the document, please do not update
README.md directory, rather update the MarkDown files in docs/ directory. README.md
is generated by assembling the individual Markdown files in docs/ directory.
