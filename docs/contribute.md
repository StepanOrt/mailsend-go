# Contributing

Please send a pull request if you add features, fixed bugs or update the documentation. 

If you want to update the document, please *do not update README.md directly*, 
rather update the Markdown files in _docs/_ directory. README.md 
is generated by [markdown_helper](https://github.com/BurdetteLamar/markdown_helper) ruby gem by
assembling the individual Markdown files in the _docs/_ directory. If you
would like to generate README.md, type `make gen`.
