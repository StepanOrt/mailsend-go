# Downloading and Installing

Pre-compiled `mailsend-go` binaries for Windows, Linux and MacOS can be
downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/releases)
page.  However, binaries for other platforms can be cross-compiled easily by setting
the [environment variables](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment) *GOOS* and *GOARCH*.

| Files | Platform |
| :-------| :--------|
| mailsend-go_1.0.1_checksums.txt| SHA256 checksum files for the binaries|
| mailsend-go_1.0.1_windows_64-bit.zip | Windows 64 bit |
| mailsend-go_1.0.1_linux_64-bit.tar.gz | Linux 64 bit|
| mailsend-go_1.0.1_mac_64-bit.tar.gz |  Mac OS X 64 bit |
| mailsend-go_linux_64-bit.rpm | RPM for Linux 64 bit |
| mailsend-go_linux_64-bit.deb | Debian package for Linux 64 bit |

Before installing please make sure to verify the checksum.

When the tgz or zip archives are extracted they create a directory mailsend-go-dir/ with the 
content.
