# Downloading

Pre-built `mailsend-go` binaries for Windows, Linux and MacOS can be
downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/releases)
page. However, binaries for other platforms can be cross-compied easily by setting
the [environment variables](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment) *GOOS* and *GOARCH*.
