# Introduction

`mailsend-go` is a command line tool to send mail via SMTP protocol. This is the
[golang](https://golang.org/) incarnation of my C version of
[mailsend](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend/). However, this version is much
simpler and all the heavy lifting is done by the package
[gomail.v2](https://gopkg.in/gomail.v2)

If you use [mailsend](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend), please consider
using mailsend-go as no new features will be added to 
[mailsend](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend).

If you have any question, request or suggestion, please enter it in the 
[Issues](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/issues) with appropriate label.

Please send a pull request if you updated, fixed a bug or updated the
documentation. 

If you would like to update the document, please do not update
README.md directory, rather update the MarkDown files in docs/ directory. README.md
is generated by assembling the individual Markdown files in docs/ directory.

# Downloading

Pre-built `mailsend-go` binaries for Windows, Linux and MacOS can be
downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go/releases)
page. However, binaries for other platforms can be cross-compied easily by setting
the [environment variables](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment) *GOOS* and *GOARCH*.

# Compiling

Compiling from scratch requires the [Go programming language toolchain](https://golang.org/dl/) and git.

To download, build and install (or upgrade) mailsend-go, run:

```
go get -u github.com/muquit/mailsend-go
```
If you see the error message `go: cannot find main module; see 'go help
modules'`, make sure GO111MODULE env variable is not set to on. Unset it by
typing `unset GO111MODULE`


To compile yourself:

* If you are using very old version of go, install dependecies by typing:

```
make tools
make
```

* If you are using go 1.11+, dependencies will be installed via go modules.
If you cloned mailsend-go inside your $GOPATH, you have to set env var:

```
export GO111MODULE=on
```
* Finally compile mailsend-go by typing:

```
make
```

As mailsend-go uses go modules, it can be built outside $GOPATH e.g.
```
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go.git
cd mailsend-go
make
```

Type `make help` for more targets:


# Examples

Each example mailsend-go command is a single line. In Unix back slash \ 
can be used to continue in the next line. Also in Unix, use single quotes 
instead of double quotes, otherwise if input has any shell character like 
$ etc, it will get expanded by the shell.

## Show SMTP server information

### StartTLS will be used if server supports it

```
  mailsend-go -info -smtp smtp.gmail.com -port 587
```    

```

### Use SSL. Note the port is different

```
  mailsend-go -info -smtp smtp.gmail.com -port 465 -ssl
```

## Send mail with a text message

Notice "auth" is a command and it takes -user and -pass arguments. "body" is
also a command and here it took -msg as an argument. The command "body" can
not repeat, if specified more than once, the last one will be used.

```
    mailsend-go -sub "Test"  -smtp smtp.gmail.com -port 587 \
     auth \
      -user jsnow@gmail.com -pass "secret" \
     -from "jsnow@gmail.com" -to  "mjane@example.com" \
     body \
       -msg "hello, world!"
```                    
The environament variable "SMTP_USER_PASS" can be used instead of the flag
`-pass`.

## Send mail with a HTML message
```
    mailsend-go -sub "Test"  \
    -smtp smtp.gmail.com -port 587 \
    auth \
     -user jsnow@gmail.com -pass "secret" \
    -from "jsnow@gmail.com"  \
    -to  "mjane@example.com" -from "jsnow@gmail.com" \
    body \
     -msg "<b>hello, world!</b>"
```

## Attach a PDF file
MIME type will be detected. Content-Disposition will be set to "attchment",
Content-Transfer-Encoding will be "Base64". Notice, "attach" is a command it
took -file as an arg. The command "attach" can repeat.
```
    mailsend-go -sub "Test"  \
    -smtp smtp.gmail.com -port 587 \
    auth \
     -user jsnow@gmail.com -pass "secret" \
    -from "jsnow@gmail.com"  \
    -to  "mjane@example.com" -from "jsnow@gmail.com" \
    body \
     -msg "A PDF file is attached" \
    attach \
     -file "/path/file.pdf"

```
## Attach a PDF file and an image
Notice, the "attach" command is repeated here.
```
    mailsend-go -sub "Test"  \
    -smtp smtp.gmail.com -port 587 \
    auth \
     -user jsnow@gmail.com -pass "secret" \
    -from "jsnow@gmail.com"  \
    -to  "mjane@example.com" -from "jsnow@gmail.com" \
    body \
     -msg "A PDF file and a PNG file is attached" \
    attach \
     -file "/path/file.pdf" \
    attach \
     -file "/path/file.png"
```
## Attach a PDF file and embed an image
Content-Dispositon for the image will be set to "inline". It's an hint to the
mail redear to display the image on the page. Note: it is just a hint, it is
up to the mail reader to respect it or ignore it.
```
    mailsend-go -sub "Test"  \
    -smtp smtp.gmail.com -port 587 \
    auth \
     -user jsnow@gmail.com -pass "secret" \
    -from "jsnow@gmail.com"  \
    -to  "mjane@example.com" -from "jsnow@gmail.com" \
    body \
     -msg "A PDF file is attached, image should be displayed inline" \
    attach \
     -file "/path/file.pdf" \
    attach \
     -file "/path/file.png" \
     -inline
```
## Set Sender and Recipient's name
```
    mailsend-go -sub "Testing -fname and -tname"  \
    -smtp smtp.gmail.com -port 587 \
    auth \
     -user example@gmail.com -pass "secret" \
     -to jsoe@example.com \
     -tname "John Soe" \
     -fname "Example Foo" \
     -f "example@gmail.com" \
     body -msg "Testing Recipient and Sender's name"
```
## Set Carbon Copy and Blind Carbon copy
```
    mailsend-go -sub "Testing -cc and -bcc" \
    -smtp smtp.gmail.com -port 587 \
    auth \
     -user example@gmail.com -pass "secret" \
     -to jsoe@example.com \
     -f "example@gmail.com" \
     -cc "user1@example.com,user2@example.com" \
     -bcc "foo@example.com" \
     body -msg "Testing Carbon Copy and Blind Carbon copy"
```
Cc addresses will be visible to the recipients but Bcc address will not be.

## Send mail to a list of users

Create a file with list of users. The syntax is ```Name,email_address``` in a line. Name can be empty but comma must be specified. Example of a list file:

```
John Snow,jsnow@example.com
Mary Jane,mjane@example.com
,foobar@example.com
```

Specify the list file with ```-list``` flag. 

```
    mailsend-go -sub "Test sending mail to a list of users" \
    -smtp smtp.gmail.com -port 587 \
    auth \
     -user example@gmail.com -pass "secret" \
        -f "me@example.com" \
        -to "xyz@example.com" \
        body \
        -msg "This is a test of sendmail mail to a list of users" \
        attach \
            -file "cat.jpg" \
         attach \
            -file "flower.jpg" \
            -inline \
         -list "list.txt"
```

## Add Custom Headers

Use the command "header" to add custom headers. The command "header" can be
repeated.

```
    mailsend-go -sub "Testing custom headers" \
    -smtp smtp.gmail.com -port 587 \
    auth \
     -user example@gmail.com -pass "secret" \
     -to jsoe@example.com \
     -f "example@gmail.com" \
     body -msg "Testing adding Custom headers"
     header \
         -name "X-MyHeader-1" -value "Value of X-MyHeader-1" \
     header \
         -name "X-MyHeader-2" -value "Value of X-MyHeader-2"
